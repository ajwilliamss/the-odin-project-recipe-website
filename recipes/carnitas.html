    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carnitas means 'little meats' and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe is made much easier using the
      slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and
      burritos.
      This filling is also great combined with your favorite barbecue sauce and served on buns.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon crumbled dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. Coat pork with the spice
        mixture.
        Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the
        sides
        of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.</li>
      <li>Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn the meat after it has
        cooked for 5
        hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Use cooking liquid as needed
        to
        moisten the meat.</li>
    </ol>
